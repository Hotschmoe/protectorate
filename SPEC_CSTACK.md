# SPEC: Cortical Stack (Memory System)

## Summary

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Base** | Fork `beads_rust` (Rust) |
| **Intelligence** | Port from `beads_viewer` (Go -> Rust) |
| **Binary** | Single unified tool (~8-10 MB) |
| **Name** | `cortical-stack` (CLI: `cstk`) |
| **Standalone** | Yes - works without Protectorate |
| **Directory** | `.cstack/` |

## Overview

The Cortical Stack is the memory and task management system for Protectorate sleeves. Rather than building from scratch, we fork **beads_rust** and port graph intelligence from **beads_viewer** into a single unified Rust binary.

**Decision**: Fork beads_rust, port beads_viewer intelligence, single binary.

## Naming

| What | Name | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Repository | `cortical-stack` | Altered Carbon reference, our identity |
| CLI command | `cstk` | Unique, no conflicts, memorable |
| Data directory | `.cstack/` | Our identity, clean break from upstream |
| Issue IDs | `cs-xxxx` | Our prefix (configurable) |

We use `.cstack/` (not `.cstack/`) because:
- Clean identity separation from upstream beads
- Signals this is cortical-stack, not beads
- Avoids confusion if user has both tools installed
- We're forking and customizing heavily anyway

**Migration note**: Users coming from beads can run `cstk migrate` to convert `.cstack/` to `.cstack/`.

## Design Principles

### Standalone First

```
cortical-stack is a GENERAL-PURPOSE tool.
Anyone can use it for their projects.
It has ZERO Protectorate dependencies.

Protectorate-specific behavior (hypothesis auto-capture,
resleeve triggers, envoy polling) lives in the SIDECAR,
not in cortical-stack itself.
```

### Single Binary

```
ONE tool to install, ONE tool to learn.
No separate viewer, no daemon, no services.
~8-10 MB static binary with everything included.
```

### Non-Invasive

```
cortical-stack NEVER runs git automatically.
User controls when to sync, when to commit.
Explicit operations only.
```

## Decisions (Resolved)

### Q1: Go-based beads or Rust-based beads?

**Answer: beads_rust**

| Factor | beads_rust wins |
|--------|-----------------|
| Binary size | 5-8 MB vs 30+ MB |
| Startup | <50ms vs 200+ms |
| Memory | <30 MB vs 80+ MB |
| Philosophy | Non-invasive (explicit sync) |
| Complexity | 26K lines vs 206K lines |
| Extensibility | Easier to modify |

### Q2: Include beads_viewer intelligence?

**Answer: Yes, port to Rust and merge into single binary**

Rather than shipping two binaries (br + bv), we port the essential graph intelligence algorithms from beads_viewer (Go) into our beads_rust fork (Rust).

**Benefits**:
- Single binary (~8-10 MB vs 8 + 15 = 23 MB)
- One tool to learn
- Consistent UX
- Fewer dependencies in sleeve containers
- Full control over the codebase

**What we port**:
- Graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles)
- Triage scoring algorithm
- Parallel execution planning

**What we skip (V1)**:
- Semantic search (use basic text search)
- Git correlation (add in V2)
- Burndown/forecast (add in V2)
- TUI (not needed)

## User Workflow Vision

The cortical stack enables an autonomous agent workflow:

```
INTERVIEW --> SPEC --> BEADS --> AUTONOMOUS WORK --> COMPLETION
```

### Phase 1: Interview (Human + AI)

User starts with an idea, ethos, vision. AI conducts structured interview:
- 70-100 questions covering requirements, constraints, preferences
- Captures edge cases, error handling expectations
- Documents non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Records user's mental model and terminology

Output: `INTERVIEW.md` - comprehensive requirements capture

### Phase 2: Specification (AI generates)

AI synthesizes interview into formal specification:
- Architecture overview
- Component breakdown
- API contracts
- Data models
- Integration points

Output: `SPEC.md` - detailed technical specification

### Phase 3: Beads Generation (AI decomposes)

AI breaks specification into atomic tasks:
- Each task is a single bead with clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies explicitly modeled (blocks/blocked-by)
- Milestones defined as parent beads
- Testing milestones interspersed throughout
- Estimate: **300-600 beads** for a substantial project

Output: `.cstack/` populated with full task graph

### Phase 4: Autonomous Execution (Sleeves)

Envoy orchestrates sleeve work:
- Sleeve queries `cstk triage --robot` for prioritized recommendations
- Works task, updates bead status via `cstk update`
- Envoy monitors progress via sidecar `/status` endpoint
- Resleeve on stuck/error conditions
- Route questions to other sleeves or escalate to human

### Phase 5: Completion & Notification

Envoy notifies user when:
- Major milestone completed
- Critical blocker requiring human input
- Agent appears stuck (no progress on ready tasks)
- All beads completed

---

## Sleeve Integration

### Boot Sequence

```
1. Sidecar starts
2. Calls: cstk triage --robot
3. Presents top recommendation to AI CLI with reasoning
4. AI accepts task
5. Sidecar calls: cstk update <id> --status in_progress
```

### Work Loop

```
1. AI works on current task
2. On completion:
   - Sidecar calls: cstk close <id> --reason "summary"
   - Sidecar calls: cstk triage --robot
   - Presents next task
3. On blocker:
   - Sidecar calls: cstk update <id> --status blocked
   - Sidecar calls: cstk comment <id> "blocked by X"
   - Sidecar calls: cstk triage --robot (skip blocked, get next)
4. On error:
   - Sidecar captures context
   - May trigger resleeve
```

### Pre-Resleeve

```
1. Sidecar detects resleeve trigger (stuck, error, manual)
2. Auto-captures:
   - cstk hypothesis <id> "was attempting X approach"
   - cstk comment <id> "error: <context>"
3. Resleeve proceeds
```

### Post-Resleeve

```
1. New sleeve boots, sidecar reads .cstack/
2. Calls: cstk show <in_progress_id> --robot
3. Reads hypothesis field
4. Presents to AI CLI:
   "Previous sleeve was attempting: X
    Error encountered: Y
    Suggested next step: Z"
5. New sleeve continues or pivots
```

---

## Schema Extensions

### Hypothesis Field (New)

Added to beads_rust Issue struct:

```rust
pub struct Issue {
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// What the agent is ABOUT TO TRY, not just what was done.
    /// Critical for resleeve continuity.
    /// Set via: cstk hypothesis <id> "trying X approach"
    /// Cleared on close or via: cstk hypothesis <id> --clear
    pub hypothesis: Option<String>,
}
```

**SQLite schema addition**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE issues ADD COLUMN hypothesis TEXT;
```

**JSONL serialization**:
```json
{
  "id": "cs-a1b2",
  "title": "Implement auth",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "hypothesis": "Trying JWT approach with refresh tokens"
}
```

### Why Hypothesis Matters

```
Without hypothesis:
  Sleeve A works on auth, gets stuck, resleeved.
  Sleeve B sees: "auth task in_progress"
  Sleeve B has no idea what A was trying.
  Sleeve B may retry the same failed approach.

With hypothesis:
  Sleeve A records: "trying JWT with RS256"
  Sleeve A gets stuck, auto-captures: "error: key generation failed"
  Sleeve B sees: "was trying JWT with RS256, failed on key gen"
  Sleeve B tries different approach: "trying JWT with HS256"
```

## Needlecast Integration

cortical-stack handles TASKS. Needlecast handles MESSAGES.

```
.cstack/             # What to do (task graph)
.needlecast/        # What to say (inter-sleeve communication)
```

These are orthogonal systems:
- Task blocked on auth module -> `cstk update cs-a1b2 --status blocked`
- "Hey alice, I pushed auth changes" -> needlecast message

Needlecast is a separate spec (SPEC_NEEDLECAST.md).

### beads_viewer Analysis

**Purpose**: Graph-aware AI agent interface built on top of beads.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Language** | Go 1.25+ |
| **Size** | 23 packages, 358 files |
| **Main entry** | 6,592 lines (monolithic dispatcher) |
| **TUI** | Charmbracelet (Bubble Tea) stack |
| **Dependencies** | gonum (graph), charmbracelet (TUI), zero external APIs |

#### Robot Protocol Commands (44+ commands)

**Core Triage**:
```
bv --robot-triage          # Mega-command: everything AI needs
bv --robot-next            # Single top recommendation
bv --robot-triage-by-track # Group by execution track
```

**Graph Intelligence**:
```
bv --robot-insights        # Full 9 metrics dashboard
bv --robot-graph           # DAG export (JSON/DOT/Mermaid)
bv --robot-plan            # Parallel execution tracks
```

**Search & History**:
```
bv --robot-search          # Semantic + hybrid search
bv --robot-history         # Bead-to-commit correlation
bv --robot-file-beads      # Beads touching a file
```

**Forecasting**:
```
bv --robot-burndown        # Sprint burndown
bv --robot-forecast        # ETA predictions
bv --robot-capacity        # Parallelization simulation
```

#### 9 Graph Metrics Computed

1. **PageRank** - Network importance (prestige)
2. **Betweenness Centrality** - Bottleneck detection
3. **Eigenvector Centrality** - Influencer detection
4. **HITS (Hubs/Authorities)** - Aggregators vs prerequisites
5. **Critical Path Score** - Longest path to terminal
6. **K-Core Decomposition** - Structural cohesion
7. **Articulation Points** - Single points of failure
8. **Slack** - Parallelizable work buffer
9. **Cycles** - Circular dependency detection

**Key Design**: Phase 1 metrics are instant. Phase 2 metrics are async with 500ms timeout. Status reporting tells agents which metrics are trustworthy.

#### Extractability Assessment: 8/10

- `pkg/analysis/` - Graph metrics, triage (fully extractable)
- `pkg/correlation/` - Git history linking (standalone)
- `pkg/search/` - Semantic search (standalone)
- `pkg/ui/` - TUI (can be removed for robot-only mode)

**Could be split into**: Library (metrics) + CLI (robot commands) + TUI (optional)

## Graph Intelligence (Ported from beads_viewer)

### Algorithms to Port

| Algorithm | Purpose | Rust Library | Effort |
|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| PageRank | Network importance | `petgraph` built-in | Low |
| Betweenness | Bottleneck detection | `petgraph` built-in | Low |
| Articulation Points | Single points of failure | `petgraph` built-in | Low |
| Cycle Detection | Circular deps | `petgraph` built-in | Low |
| Critical Path | Longest path to terminal | Topo sort + DP | Medium |
| HITS (Hubs/Auth) | Aggregators vs prereqs | ~100 lines iterative | Medium |
| Eigenvector | Influencer detection | `nalgebra` or custom | Medium |
| K-Core | Structural cohesion | ~80 lines | Medium |

**petgraph** covers 60% of what we need out of the box.

### Triage Scoring (from beads_viewer)

```
score = (
    pagerank_weight     * pagerank_score     +  # 0.35
    betweenness_weight  * betweenness_score  +  # 0.25
    blocker_weight      * blocker_count      +  # 0.20
    staleness_weight    * days_stale         +  # 0.10
    priority_weight     * priority_score        # 0.10
)
```

Each recommendation includes:
- **Score**: 0.0-1.0 (higher = more urgent)
- **Breakdown**: Component scores
- **Reasons[]**: Human-readable explanations
- **Unblocks[]**: What gets unblocked if this completes

### Output Modes

```
cstk triage              # Human-readable table
cstk triage --json       # Machine-readable JSON
cstk triage --robot      # Alias for --json (agent-friendly)
```

### Phased Metrics (from beads_viewer design)

**Phase 1 (instant, always available)**:
- Degree (in/out)
- Topological order
- Density
- Ready work count

**Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout)**:
- PageRank
- Betweenness
- HITS
- Critical path

Status flags tell consumers which metrics are trustworthy:
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "pagerank": { "status": "computed", "elapsed_ms": 45 },
    "betweenness": { "status": "timeout", "elapsed_ms": 500 }
  }
}
```

## File Structure

```
project/
  .cstack/
    beads.db          # SQLite - fast local queries
    issues.jsonl      # Git-sync format
    config.yaml       # Project-specific settings
    .history/         # Timestamped backups (optional)
```

**No .cstack/ wrapper** - cortical-stack uses standard .cstack/ directory for compatibility with upstream beads ecosystem.

## Standalone vs Protectorate Usage

### Standalone Usage (Anyone)

```bash
# Initialize in any project
cd my-project
cstk init

# Create tasks from spec
cstk create "Implement auth" --type feature --priority 1
cstk create "Add login endpoint" --type task
cstk dep add cs-002 cs-001  # Login depends on auth

# Work on tasks
cstk triage                 # What should I work on?
cstk update cs-002 --status in_progress
# ... do work ...
cstk close cs-002 --reason "Implemented"

# Sync with git
cstk sync --flush-only
git add .cstack/
git commit -m "Complete login endpoint"
```

### Protectorate Usage (Sleeves)

The sidecar wraps cortical-stack with Protectorate-specific behavior:

```
Sidecar Hooks (not in cs itself):

1. Boot:
   - Read .cstack/, call cstk triage --robot
   - Present top task to AI CLI

2. Work Loop:
   - Monitor AI CLI activity
   - On task claim: cstk update --status in_progress
   - On completion: cstk close, cstk triage for next

3. Pre-Resleeve:
   - Auto-call: cstk hypothesis <current> "was attempting X"
   - Auto-call: cstk comment <current> "error context..."

4. Post-Resleeve:
   - Read hypothesis from in_progress task
   - Present to new AI CLI: "Previous sleeve was trying X"
```

**Key Point**: cortical-stack knows nothing about sleeves, sidecars, or envoy. It's just a task tracker with graph intelligence. Protectorate wraps it.
